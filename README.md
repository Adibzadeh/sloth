Sloth is a self-hosted commenting platform written in pure PHP that provides the functionality of commenting and reactions using emojis on any page of your website. You can use Sloth to enable users to comment in the middle of your posts, like leaving little notes or let them react to parts of your pages using emojis. If you have a static website, such as GitHub pages, you can host Sloth somewhere and let your users leave comments for your posts and products with ease.
